# What is Dummygram?

## Vision

When you learn ReactJs it seems obvious to work on some projects and for the projects you might want to choose something that interests you. How about a clone of the app developed by the company that released ReactJs ? Yes, you might be getting the point, this application is basically a clone of the original Instagram and tends to add features like instagram or in fact the features that could not have been added in the instagram. So what are you waiting for? Use this opportunity to contribute and learn. :smiley:
