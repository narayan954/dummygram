<h1 align="center">About Dummygram</h1>

## Vision

When embarking on the journey of learning ReactJS, it's essential to engage in projects that capture your interest. One compelling idea is to create a clone of the app developed by the company that released ReactJS itself. In this case, let's consider building an Instagram clone, which not only replicates the features offered by the popular social media platform but also introduces new functionalities.

Developing an Instagram clone presents an incredible opportunity for learning and growth. By undertaking this project, you can contribute to the ReactJS community while expanding your knowledge and skills

## Status

Since its inception in September 2022, Dummygram has been a passion project with a strong commitment to excellence. From its earliest stages, the project found a home on GitHub, a testament to its collaborative nature and openness to community contributions. While the current priorities and ongoing development efforts are clear, the team behind Dummygram remains dedicated to infusing the application with a distinctive visual appeal and a wealth of exciting features.

With a keen eye for design, the Dummygram team is determined to give the app a unique look that sets it apart from its counterparts. Through thoughtful and creative design choices, they aim to create a visually stunning user interface that captures the attention and imagination of users. By leveraging the power of ReactJS, the team has the flexibility to implement custom styles and create an engaging and immersive user experience:sparkles:

## Features

User Authentication: DummyGram includes a user authentication system, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and log out securely. This feature ensures that only authenticated users can access and interact with the app.

Posts: Users can create posts and share them with others. Posts can include various types of content, such as images, videos, or text. Users can upload media files from their devices or provide URLs for online content. These posts are displayed in a feed-like format.

Commenting: DummyGram enables users to comment on posts. Users can write and submit comments on individual posts, engaging in conversations and discussions with other users.

Like Feature: Users can express their appreciation for posts by liking them. This feature allows users to show their support and interest in specific content shared on DummyGram.

Delete Functionality: DummyGram allows users to delete their own posts. This feature provides users with control over their content, enabling them to remove posts they no longer wish to keep on the platform.

Frontend Framework: The user interface of DummyGram is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. ReactJS allows for efficient rendering of components and provides a smooth and responsive user experience.

Backend and Data Storage: DummyGram utilizes Firebase as the backend service for storing user data, posts, and comments. Firebase provides a scalable and reliable platform for handling backend functionalities and offers real-time database capabilities, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Codebase

### Technologies

With the ground rules out of the way, let's talk about the coarse architecture of this mono repo:

**Frontend JavaScript**: We use React to power our frontend apps. Almost all of the code you'll touch in this codebase will be JavaScript.
<img  src="http://3con14.biz/code/_data/js/intro/js-logo.png"  alt="JS"  width="30"  height="30">

Here is a list of all the big technologies we use:

- **React**: Frontend React app <img  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalbertsr/logo-badge-images/master/img/react_logo.png"  alt="REACT"  width="35"  height="35">

- **Firebase**: Data storage and Authentication <img  src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/google-i-o-2016/512/google_firebase-2-128.png"  alt="FIREBASE"  width="30"  height="30">

### Folder structure

```sh

dummygram/

├── public # Public files used on the frontend

├── src # Frontend Code in React

```

## Project Setup

### First time setup

The first step to running dummygram locally is downloading the code by cloning the repository:

<details><summary>Video Demo to run Dummygram in your local under 2 minutes</summary> <br>

<https://github.com/narayan954/dummygram/assets/77617189/c21f0bdc-e845-4c32-b148-54d8048cbc33>

</details>

```sh

git clone git@github.com:narayan954/dummygram.git

```

If you get `Permission denied` error using `ssh` refer [here](https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/)

or use `https` link as a fallback.

```sh

git clone https://github.com/narayan954/dummygram.git

```

### Installation

Dummygram has a single installation step:

- **Install the dependencies**:

```sh

npm install

```

You've now finished installing everything! Let's start :100:

Ps: if you're getting error installing the dependencies, try --force command along with npm install. For example

```sh

npm install --force

```

Now you're ready to run the app locally and sign into your local instance!

### Running the app locally

#### Start the servers

To Start the development server run

```sh
npm start
```

## Testing

Here we will see, how to run tests and how to setup new test cases.
_We will be using Cypress for our testing purposes._

### Introduction to Cypress

<img src='https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/overview/v10/real-world-app.png' width='920'>

<details><summary>See More</summary> <br>

Cypress is a relatively new automated tests tool which is gaining popularity at a very rapid pace

Here is the home page for Cypress if someone wants to look it up
<https://www.cypress.io/>

Cypress has very strong documentation so a new comer could find most of the information from their own site
<https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell>

Also as a starting point it would be good to go through these tutorial videos
<https://docs.cypress.io/examples/tutorials>

</details>

### Start Testing

> You need to [setup](#project-setup) the project as usual, and after that we can run our test cases.

<sub>See It Running</sub>

<details><summary>See More</summary> <br>

1. **Run This Command**

```zsh
npm run cypress:open
```

_It will open up this window,_

### Create New Test Cases

Working Directory: `/cypress/` <br>
E2E Files: `/cypress/e2e/`

<img width="720" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84321236/223501582-99163f05-940c-4e9a-a59a-8951a1be1e3a.png">

<details><summary>See More</summary> <br>

**To Create New E2E Tests**

1. Goto `/cypress/e2e/`
2. You can create new file (similar to `spec.cy.js`). <br>
   **OR** add new `it` function inside existing `describe` function in this existing file.

<img width="720" alt="test-file-screenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84321236/223485219-2fd93fa7-686e-4a60-92b0-2a927ee4a7b0.png">

3. Then, [test](#start-testing) your test cases:

   ```zsh
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

## How to get started with Open Source

Here's a quick rundown on how to get started with open source. First of all, let's know some basic terminologies:

- Git: This is a versioning system that lets you store your code and code history on your local computer, preventing loss and allowing sharing of that code.
- Github: This is a server that lets you store the history in a database.
- Open Source: A project is said to be open sourced if you can see the code on GitHub.
- Fork: This is a copy that you make of a project on GitHub, it gets added to your repositories.
- Repository: A project on GitHub is called a repository.
- Pull Request: This is a fix for an issue proposed to be done in a project, this consists of you editing a file in the project.
- Issue: An issue is a change that should be done in a project, can be a bug, a new feature or a suggestion to a project.
- Branch: A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace(main or master) that allows you to work on something without affecting the original code.

Now you know some basic terms, let's get into how to get started with some resources to let you understand open source better:

- [Crash Course to Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics) - Video
- [A complete Guide to Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE) - Video

## How to use Dummygram

[Flow of Control](FlowOfControl.md)

## Contributing

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards! :raised_hands:**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope—it's our entire product.

## Rules

- **No `console.log`s in any file**: We use the `debug` module across the codebase to log debugging information in development only. Never commit a file that contains a `console.log` as CI will fail your build. The only exceptions are errors, which you can log, but you have to use `console.error` to be explicit about it
- **Code reviews**: All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
